Gui Goals:
-Control Flow:
	- load an existing or create a new playfile
	- edit the playfile in an spreadsheet setting
	- save the playfile
	- parse the playfile and send the commands
-Use either MA or DAC resolution + Direction units to specify currents

Modifications to Playfile Format:
- MA current instead of DAC resolution + Direction
- Direction information inferred from current

Issues:
-Pointers to panels getting deleted: try using references instead of pointers
-trying to create class object (can't use a default constructor, or can I?), but keep getting the following error:
"operator= can not be referenced-- it is a deleted function" when trying to dereference "new X()"
